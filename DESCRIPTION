Description: Enables binary package installations on Linux distributions.
    Provides functions to manage packages via the distribution's package
    manager. Also provides transparent integration with R's install.packages()
    and a fallback mechanism. When installed as a system package, interacts
    with the system's package manager without requiring administrative
    privileges via an integrated D-Bus service; otherwise, uses sudo.
    Currently, the following backends are supported: DNF, APT, ALPM.
