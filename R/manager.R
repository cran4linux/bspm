#' Manage Packages from System Repositories
#'
#' Talk to the system package manager to install/remove... packages from system
#' repositories (see details for further options).
#'
#' @param pkgs character vector of names of packages.
#' @return Functions \code{install_sys} and \code{remove_sys} return, invisibly,
#' a character vector of the names of packages not available in the system.
#'
#' @details If \R runs with root privileges (e.g., in a docker container), these
#' functions talk directly to the system package manager. Regular users are also
#' able to install/remove packages without any administrative permission via the
#' accompanying D-Bus service if \pkg{bspm} is installed as a system package.
#' If not, these methods fall back on using \code{sudo} to elevate permissions
#' (or \code{pkexec} in GUIs such as RStudio) in interactive sessions. Note
#' that, if you want to fall back to \code{sudo} in a non-interactive session,
#' you need to set \code{options(bspm.sudo=TRUE)}.
#'
#' If \code{options(bspm.sudo.autodetect=TRUE)}, \pkg{bspm} tries to detect
#' whether it is running in an environment where password-less \code{sudo} can
#' be used (e.g., in a containerized environment such as a Fedora Toolbox) for
#' every call, and then uses \code{sudo} accordingly.
#'
#' By default, if a package is not available in the system repositories, it is
#' installed from R's configured repositories along with all its dependencies.
#' This behavior can be changed via \code{options(bspm.always.install.deps=TRUE)},
#' which tries to install from system repositories recursive dependencies of
#' those packages that are not available. For example, if \pkg{A} depends on
#' \pkg{B}, and \pkg{B} is available in the system repositories but \pkg{A} is
#' not, then only \pkg{A} will be installed from CRAN with this option enabled,
#' and both will be installed from CRAN with this option disabled (default).

#' # install 'units' and all its dependencies from the system repos
#' bspm::install_sys("units")

#' # now remove it
#' bspm::remove_sys("units")

install_sys <- function(pkgs) {
  not.avail <- backend_call("install", pkgs)
  if (length(not.avail) && getOption("bspm.always.install.deps", FALSE)) {
    deps <- tools::package_dependencies(not.avail, recursive=TRUE)
    deps <- unique(unlist(deps, use.names=FALSE))

  }
  not.avail

#' @details The \code{discover} method is only needed when e.g. a new repository
#' is added that contains packages with different prefixes (for example, your
#' system repositories may provide packages called \code{r-cran-*} and
#' \code{r-bioc-*} and then you add a new repository that provides packages
#' called \code{r-github-*}). Otherwise, it will not have any effect besides
#' regenerating the internal configuration files.
