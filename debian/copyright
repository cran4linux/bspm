This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-bspm package of bspm.  The
bspm package offers convolution-type smoothed quantile regression.
It was written by I単aki Ucar.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	https://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'bspm' to
'r-cran-bspm' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN)
packages for R.
